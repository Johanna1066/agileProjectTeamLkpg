This is the code for the controller for the RC-car.
The components we used to build our controller was:
  + 2 Analog Joysticks
  + 1 Arduino Nano ESP 32
  + 1 Breadboard 5v PSU
  + 1 Breadboard
  + cables

We also used these librarys; Arduino.h, esp_now.h, WiFi.h and semphr.h

To use this on your own you also have to figure out the MAC adress for the reciver Arduino, the one that goes on the car.
When you have the MAC adress to the reciver Arduino you have to change it in the code so it fits your Arduinos MAC-adress.

After that you can follow this wiring diagram:
